*** JavaScript in the browser
- Do not commit *console.log* to your repo. It’s ugly, it kills performance and it can make confidential data be visible to anyone using the browser tools to look at your website.
- Do not use *window.alert()* or *window.confirm()*. It’s ugly, impossible to style, it stops code execution and displays differently on different browsers. Use custom modal instead.
- Keep the number of changes/updates to the DOM as low as possible, they are very expensive for the browser.
- Keep the application logic separated from DOM manipulation tasks.
- Do not use *document.write* or *eval*
- Add *node_modules* dir to you.gitignore file as all those files are not needed in your repo (each team member will install all packages thanks to your package.json file).
