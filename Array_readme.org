** Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift().
- Both methods take one or more elements as parameters and add those elements to the array the method is being called on; the *push()* method adds elements to the end of an array, and *unshift()* adds elements to the beginning. Consider the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC js
let twentyThree = 'XXIII';
let romanNumerals = ['XXI', 'XXII'];

romanNumerals.unshift('XIX', 'XX');
// *romanNumerals* would have the value *['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII']*.

romanNumerals.push(twentyThree);
// *romanNumerals* would have the value *['XIX', 'XX', 'XXI', 'XXII', 'XXIII']*. 
//Notice that we can also pass variables, which allows us even greater flexibility in dynamically modifying our array's data.
#+END_SRC

** Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()
- *pop()* removes an element from the end of an array, while *shift()* removes an element from the beginning. 
#+BEGIN_SRC js

let greetings = ['whats up?', 'hello', 'see ya!'];

greetings.pop();
#+END_SRC

- greetings would have the value ['whats up?', 'hello'].
#+BEGIN_SRC js

greetings.shift();

- greetings would have the value ['hello'].
#+END_SRC

- We can also return the value of the removed element with either method like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC js

let popped = greetings.pop();
#+END_SRC

- greetings would have the value [], and popped would have the value hello.

** Could be a example this code: 
#+BEGIN_SRC js
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop();
  let shifted = arr.shift() ; 
  let answer = popped +' '+ shifted; //I'm not sure if this declariton it's correct 
  return [answer];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));
#+END_SRC
**** Please leave a comment or open a issue with a refactor of the above code 

*** we can use this code as well (Itâ€™s as above code, but this code was tested & already worked properly): 

#+BEGIN_SRC js
function popShift(arr) {
  let popped = arr.pop(); 
  let shifted = arr.shift() ; 
  return [shifted, popped];
}

console.log(popShift(['challenge', 'is', 'not', 'complete']));
#+END_SRC
