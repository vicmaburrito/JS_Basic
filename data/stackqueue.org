* Implementing Javascript Stack Using an Array
** Introduction to the stack data structure
- A stack is a data structure that holds a list of elements. A stack works based on the LIFO principle i.e., Last In, First out, meaning that the most recently added element is the first one to remove.

- A stack has two main operations that occur only at the top of the stack: push and pop. The push operation places an element at the top of stack whereas the pop operation removes an element from the top of the stack.

** The name *stack* 

- The name stack comes from the analogy to a set of physical items e.g., DVD disc, books, stacked on top each other.

- A stack has many applications. For example, the simplest one is to reverse a word. To do it, you push a word into the stack, letter by letter, and pop the letters from the stack.

- The other applications of the stack are “undo” mechanism in text editors, syntax parsing, function call, and expression conversion (infix to postfix, infix to prefix, postfix to infix, and prefix to infix).

- JavaScript Array type provides the push() and pop() methods that allow you to use an array as a stack.

*** Example with push() method

#+BEGIN_SRC js
let stack = [];

stack.push(1);
console.log(stack); // [1]

stack.push(2);
console.log(stack); // [1,2]

stack.push(3);
console.log(stack); // [1,2,3]

stack.push(4);
console.log(stack); // [1,2,3,4]

stack.push(5);
console.log(stack); // [1,2,3,4,5]
#+END_SRC

**** The following figure illustrates each step in the script above.

*** *** Example with pop() method

#+BEGIN_SRC js

console.log(stack.pop()); //  5
console.log(stack); // [1,2,3,4];

console.log(stack.pop()); //  4
console.log(stack); // [1,2,3];

console.log(stack.pop()); //  3
console.log(stack); // [1,2];

console.log(stack.pop()); //  2
console.log(stack); // [1];

console.log(stack.pop()); //  1
console.log(stack); // []; -> empty

console.log(stack.pop()); //  undefined

#+END_SRC
