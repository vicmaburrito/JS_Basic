* This Code it's a lesson by Codecademy
** Using a basic operators to create logic 
*** It was Tested and Started with a general Variables as: 
    - *Var* keyword is used in pre-ES6 versions of JS.
    - *let* Is the preferred way to declare a variable when it can be reassigned.
    - *const* is the preferred way to declare a variable with a constant value.
** Other Concepts
*** Undefined 
   -Variables that have not been initialized store the primitive data type *undefined*.
*** Mathematical Operators
#+BEGIN_SRC js
    Math.random();
    // Returns a number between 0 and 1 

    Math.random();
    // ☝️ Math is the library

    let message = 'good nite';
    console.log(message.length);
    // Prints: 9

    console.log(Math.random());
    // Prints: 0 - 0.9

    console.log(Math.floor(5.95)); 
    // Prints: 5 

    // calculates # of weeks in a year, rounds down to nearest integer
    const weeksInYear = Math.floor(365/7);

    // calcuates the number of days left over after 365 is divded by 7
    const daysLeftOver = 365 % 7 ;

    console.log("A year has " + weeksInYear + " weeks and " + daysLeftOver + " days");

    let number = 100;

    // Both statements will add 10
    number = number + 10;
    number += 10;

    console.log(number); 
    // Prints: 120

    let name = "Vicma";
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`); 
    // Prints: Hello, Vicma

    console.log(`Burrito is ${6+8} years old.`); 
    // Prints: Burrito is 14 years old.

    let count; 
    console.log(count); // Prints: undefined
    count = 10;
    console.log(count); // Prints: 10
